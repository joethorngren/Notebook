#### Downtime Brainstorming Session

#####  1. Education/Professional Development Ideas:

- Udacity
    - Tack:
        - VR Developer
        - Full Stack Web Developer
    - Joe's Personal Interest
        - Full Stack Web Developer**
        - Intro to Self-Driving Cars / Self-Driving Car Engineer
        - Robotics Software Engineer
        - Artificial Intelligence
        - Machine Learning
        - Google AdWords

- Talks/Meetups (****See App Ideas**)
    - Dagger 2
    - Coroutines
    - K-Type

- Book Club
    - Erik mentioned just a plain old book club (not tech-related) to get started
    - JT + SG ---> Clean Code (Interested @EW?)

- Movie Mondays (I just posted something about this in the #android channel)

- Analytics
    - At one point, we had talked at a DevClub about creating some action items around researching the available options + learning more about how to work with them

##### 2. Internal Projects

###### Practices

- Onboarding for other Tack projects
    - Joe + Steven: HD
        - Spend a week getting familiar with app
        - Get hubs + equipment
    - Joe + Steven: YS

- Tack Code Style
    - Come up with initial/basic code style (Optional)
    - Jenkins Integration:
        - Push to a branch
        - Jenkins does a build/runs tests/etc. etc.
        - Jenkins performs auto-formatting according to the project-specific code style
            - Reformat code
            - Remove unused imports
        - Jenkins makes new commit with style + formatting changes + pushes it

- Jenkins Stuff
    - Setup internal repo for Jenkins Jobs DSL
    - Start making use of ErrorProne + Lint + custom lint checks
    - Test Coverage Reports
    - Gerritt Code Review

- @EW: Automating Tack Blog Posts
    - Next steps?

###### App Ideas

- Expand on Erik's initial AR effort

- Expand on Hackathon Projects

- Tack-Internal Reimbursement App
    - Start with getting something functional, then integrate with Google's vision API's that would extract all relevant info from a photo of a receipt
    - Make iOS version

- Generic Companion App for Talks/Meetups
    - Integrated with Speaker's slide deck
    - Live Quiz/Comprehension Checks**
        - I'm thinking a similar format to "Enki"
    - Built-in feedback mechanism
        - Replace need for Conference organizers to manually collect feedback
        - Unlike my experience with filling out feedback forms at conferences/conference apps, make the feedback valuable
        - Maybe Someday: "Buddy Build" style feedback
    - Maybe someday: Add Podium-like functionality

- Plugins: _(I have a list of different ideas for each of these floating around somewhere...)_
    - Slack
    - IntelliJ/Studio

##### 3. Everything Else

- Kotlin
    - Full Stack
    - Start Playing around with iOS/Android interop
