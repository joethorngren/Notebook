Hey All-- Couple random/quick things:

1. Bookmarks

I have known abut "Bookmarks" in IntelliJ/Studio for quite some time, but I never actually used them. This past week, I've set up four basic ones and it has been absolutely awesome. I don't know what took me so long to get on board.

As a quick little introduction, here's the basics:

* Simple Bookmarks:

You can toggle a "Simple Bookmark":one: on/off by just pressing `F11`. If you want to view your bookmarks, push `CTRL + F11`:two:. Aside from using the build in "Bookmarks Menu" that pops up when you press `CTRL + F11`, you can also tell a line/location is bookmarked in the editor tab "gutter" that is marked with a :white_check_mark:

Easy stuff. I haven't really started using these all that much.

* "Smart Bookmarks"

For these, you can press `CTRL + F11`:two: to "Toggle a bookmark with mnemonic", which enables this screen:

![bookmark_mnemonic](file:///home/oh-henry/Code_Complete/CC-Notebook/src/notes/tack/scratch/bookmark_mnemonic.png)

This is what I started using the past week and it has been great.  I have #1 (used by pressing `CTRL + 1` takes me the application's `build.gradle` file, `CTRL + 2` takes me the project's `build.gradle`, `CTRL + 3` takes me to the `AndroidManifest.xml`, and `CTRL + 4` takes me to the application class.

As the screenshot indicates, you can use 0-9 and A-Z, so there are a lot of options.

2. "Movie Mondays" or something of the like.

@steven.gerdes and I were talking last week about doing something like a weekly/bi-weekly meeting, where we could sit and watch a talk from a presentation/meetup.  My list of these seems to grow faster than I can actually watch them, so I thought this might be a better strategy for managing them.  I was thinking, we could set up a shared list and people could vote for ones that wanted to see. If we run out of those, we can just pick the next video in the list.

I'm definitely open to experimenting with the format of this, maybe we could all watch the talk on our own over the weekend/previous day, and then just have a little discussion about it, or we could actually just watch it as a group (we'll have to talk about how to handle all the different remote folks and everything). Another option might be to just maintain a curated list, and if someone watched one, they could give their general impressions, things they learned, etc. etc.

For now, I just wanted to gauge the level of interest from anyone else who might want to participate.

Let me know what you think and feel free to share any ideas/suggestions.
